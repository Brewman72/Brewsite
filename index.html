    <h1>Brew Recipes for Everyone!</h1>

    <p>Hello and welcome to my webpage. I have created this site
        to share my beer, cider and mead recipes with others and to 
        have others share their recipes. Below you will see an example
        of my Brown Ale, and you will also find a place to input your 
        OG and FG to calculate your own ABV quickly.</p>

    <p>Here is an example of one of my beers so far.</p>

    <h2>Dano's English Brown Ale</h2>

    <!--This will calculate the ABV-->

    <p>Original Gravity: 1.071</p>
    <p>Final Gravity: 1.02</p>
