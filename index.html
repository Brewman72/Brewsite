    <h1>Brew Recipes for Everyone!</h1>

    <p>Hello and welcome to my webpage. I have created this site<br>
        to share my beer, cider and mead recipes with others and to <br>
        have others share their recipes. Below you will see an example<br>
        of my Brown Ale, and you will also find a place to input your <br>
        OG and FG to calculate your own ABV quickly.</p>

    <p>Here is an example of one of my beers so far.</p>

    <h2>Dano's English Brown Ale</h2>

    <!--This will calculate the ABV-->

    <p>Original Gravity: 1.071</p>
    <p>Final Gravity: 1.02</p>
